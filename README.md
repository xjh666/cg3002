# CG3002 AY1819 Sem2 Group3 - *Dance*

## **Introduction**
### This repository is for student project - [CG3002 Embedded Systems Design Project](https://nusmods.com/modules/CG3002/embedded-systems-design-project).
The project is to develop a wearable system to detect dance movements of a human. <br/><br/>
The system consists of <br/>
* Arduino: Read data from sensors and send the data to Rasphberry Pi 3.<br/>
* Rasphberry Pi 3: Load data into Machine Learning model, send the prediction to the server.<br/>
* Machine Learning Model: Processing raw sensor data and make the prediction.<br/>
